# (Wildlife and Enhanced Water OpenGl Renderer (WEWOR)

WEWOR aims to get the best water rendering possible using openGL. 
To ensure our rendering is giving good result, we implemented a terrain generated with an height-map, 
a skybox that we can switch dynamically and the water surface rendering. 

We used modern water rendering techniques such as reflection/refraction, a DuDv map, 
Fresnel coefficient and water depth.
